# Stardew Valley Mod Development compatible devcontainer

A VSCode template configuration optimized for Stardew Valley mod development.


# Quick Start

The TL;DR of below:

-   Make sure you have SMAPI for developers installed
-   Build your mod project using the included build script (`ctrl+shift+b` or `cmd+shift+b`)
-   Happy coding! :-)


# Building your mod

VSCode tasks are included to make building your mods easier. By default a debug build will be made when using VSCode's build task (default keyboard shortcut is `ctrl+shift+b` for Linux/Windows, or `cmd+shift+b` for Mac). You can access individual tasks through VSCode's Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+p` or `cmd+shift+p` by default) to trigger a release build.

## Included tools

Some of the included tools that are possibly useful for you to use directly are:

-   `msbuild`
-   `dotnet`
-   `nuget`
